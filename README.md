Quickload Reverter
==================

This plugin lets you revert quickloads in Kerbal Space Program. I have lost too much progress by accidentally quickloading saves that were further in the past than I thought they were.

The plugin will create an extra backup save just before you quickload. To revert the quickload, press Alt-F9 and select "pre_quickload."
